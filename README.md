# covidmyanmar
Dataset collection from covidmyanmar.com

Covidmyanmar is a project started in 2020 January. We extracted Covid case data from government announcement, news and reports to compile in simplified way for researchers to reuse in their works.
Initially, the data were hosted in Google spreadsheet and visualize in Google datastudio, kumu and other visualization platforms. 
We also opened the spreadsheet for public use. 
This git is a new generation of Covidmyanmar data. 
We only changed the table names and column names without changing the core data. 
We will upload the csv files for all the data related to Myanmar Covid during 2020. 
While we are preparing to upload the datasets, you can access our our version of data from data.covidmyanmar.com and covidmyanmar.com
Stay tune!
