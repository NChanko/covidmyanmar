Dataset collection from covidmyanmar.com

Covidmyanmar is a project started in 2020 January. We extracted Covid case data from government announcement, news and reports to compile in simplified way for researchers to reuse in their works.
Initially, the data were hosted in Google spreadsheet and visualize in Google datastudio, kumu and other visualization platforms. 
We also opened the spreadsheet for public use. 
This git is a new generation of Covidmyanmar data. 
We only changed the table names and column names without changing the core data. 
We will upload the csv files for all the data related to Myanmar Covid during 2020. 
While we are preparing to upload the datasets, you can access our our version of data from data.covidmyanmar.com and covidmyanmar.com
Stay tune!

## Future work
- Add dictionary for column names.

## Contributors

These people contributed alot during the fight against COVID-19. Some of them relentlessly inputed data manually from government announcements pdfs into spreadsheet tables for days and nights.

It's not a complete list, many people advised ,encouraged and corrected the mistakes during our data collection process. I apologize to everyone we can't show in this list. But, I do remember the time we are all united in pandemic.
